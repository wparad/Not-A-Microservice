# Not-A-Microservice
This repository creates lambda functions, api gateway, and static website all so that you can serve generic webpages.

It uses angular to map json to html templates.  The html templates will be saved with the service which serves them, and the data will come from where the template defines it.  But don't take my word for it, check it out.
